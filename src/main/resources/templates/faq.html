    <h3><a id="s2q2">Is SORT available in all countries?</a></h3>
    <p>Not yet, but we are working on expanding to other territories and will be available soon.</p>

    <p>Absolutely! SORT is available for free for you to download and use all its features including SORTED!</p>

    <h3><a id="s2q4">How is SORT collecting data of movies, shows and events and their availability?</a></h3>
    <p>We use open source database for information about a title such as posters, casts, directors, synopsis etc. We then use this database to match the titles or events available at different platforms which we update regularly.</p>

    <h3><a id="s2q5">I could not find a title or event when I searched on SORT. Why?</a></h3>
    <p>It may be because of two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>That particular title may not be available with any of the providers.</li>
        <li>Or our team has not have it updated in our database. If this is the case, please be assured we are working round the clock to rectify it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a id="s2q6">Is content different in each country?</a></h3>
    <p>Yes, most services has different content in different country. For example: A movie available on Netflix in India might be available on Hulu in US. We curate our content based on each country.</p>

    <h3><a id="s2q7">Do you know upcoming movies, shows or events which are yet to be listed?</a></h3>
    <p>We will have this information only when a provider shares this with us either through advertisement or through SORT&#8217;s partnership with the provider/s. Rest assured, we will share as much information as possible with you which we legally can.</p>

    <h3><a id="s2q8">I was redirected to a different page after click on the content or event provider icon. I am confused as why this has happened?</a></h3>
    <p>If this has happened, we are very sorry as this is our fault. We probably mixed up the titles in our database. We are working around the clock to make sure we make your experience as perfect as possible.</p>
