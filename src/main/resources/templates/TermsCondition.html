                                    <br><br>1.1. Your Sort membership will continue until terminated. To use the Sort service you must have Internet access and a Sort ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means
                                    a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize
                                    us to charge&nbsp; the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).<br><br>1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in
                                    conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which
                                    will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Sort membership by visiting our website and clicking on the "Account" link available
                                    at the top of the pages under your profile name.<br></p>

                                    such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Sort membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed

                                    <br><br>3.1. <span class="underline">Billing Cycle.</span> The membership fee for the Sort service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees,
                                    will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the
                                    service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.
                                    Visit our website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through
                                    various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.&nbsp; If you signed up for Sort using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information
                                    about your Sort membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
                                    <br><br>3.2. <span class="underline">Payment Methods.</span> To use the Sort service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary
                                    Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds,
                                    or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign
                                    transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.<br><br>3.3.
                                    <span class="underline">Updating your Payment Methods.</span> You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following
                                    any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).<br><br>3.4. <span class="underline">Cancellation.</span> You can cancel your Sort membership at any time, and you will continue to have
                                    access to the Sort service through the end of your billing period. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or
                                    unwatched Sort content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing
                                    period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Sort using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your
                                    Sort membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Sort service through that third
                                    party.
                                    <br><br>3.5. <span class="underline">Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans.</span> We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription
                                    plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.<br></p>

                                    The content that may be available to watch will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified
                                    on the "Account" page.
                                    <br><br>4.4. The Sort service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces, promotional features and availability
                                    of Sort content. You can turn off tests participation at any time by visiting the "Account" page and changing the "Test participation" settings.
                                    <br><br>4.5. Some Sort content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on certain supported devices (“Offline Titles”). Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account,

                                    in certain countries and if you go online in a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline Title, the Offline Title will not be playable while you are in that country.

                                    or restrict your use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or are engaged in illegal or fraudulent use of the service.<br><br>4.7. The quality of the display of the Sort content may vary from device to device, and
                                    may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities.
                                    Not all content is available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD or HDR and not all subscription plans allow you to receive content in all formats. Default playback settings on cellular networks exclude HD, Ultra HD and HDR content.
                                    The minimum connection speed for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. A download speed of at least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content (defined as a
                                    resolution of 720p or higher). A download speed of at least 15.0&nbsp; Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD (defined as a resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with
                                    your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching Sort content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time,
                                    the content you have selected and the configuration of your Sort ready device.
                                    <br><br>4.8. Sort software is developed by, or for, Sort and may solely be used for authorized streaming and viewing of Sort content through Sort ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities

                                    To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the Sort ready devices
                                    that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide
