                        <p>This Policy describes how we treat personal information on the websites where it is located.</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>We collect information from you passively. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons to collect information from you.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>We may share information with third parties.</p>

                        <p>We will share information with our business partners. For example, we may share information with third parties who operate our &#8220;find ads near me&#8221; feature. We may also share information with third parties who co-sponsor a promotion. We may also share information with our retail partners. This might include those whose circulars and ads appear on our platforms.
                            We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.
                            </br>For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We might share information when we are investigating potential fraud.
                            </br>We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.For example, if part of our business was sold we may give our
                            customer list as part of that transaction.
                            </br>We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.</p>

                        <p>You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.</p>

                        <p>You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us.
                            Don&#8217;t worry - even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages.
                            These include responses to your questions or information about your account. You can control cookies and tracking tools.</p>

                        <p>We use standard security measures.</p>

                        <p>The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.</p>

                        <p>We may link to other sites or have third party services on our site we don&#8217;t control.</p>

                        <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This includes social media sites. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites.
                            Read the privacy policy of other websites and insurance carriers carefully. We are not responsible for these third party practices.
                            </br>Our site and apps may also link to and/or serve third party ads or other content that contains their own cookies or tracking technologies.</p>

                        <p>We use tracking technologies for many reasons?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>To understand the activities and behaviors of our consumers and website visitors.</li>
                            <li>To recognize new visitors to our websites and apps.</li>
                            <li>To recognize past customers.</li>
                            <li>To serve you with customized or interest-based advertising. These ads may appear on our website or others you visit.</li>
                            <li>So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We engage in interest-based advertising.</p>

                        <p>We may serve interest-based advertising using personal and other information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include apps. These ads are served on websites or apps.
                            They might also be served in emails. Interest-based or &#8220;online behavioural advertising&#8221; includes ads that are served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return.
                            They also include ads we think are relevant to you based on your shopping habits or online activities.</p>

                        <p>How do we gather relevant information for interest-based advertising?</p>

                        <p>To decide what is relevant to you, we might look at your purchases, collect certain mobile unique operating system IDs or browsing behaviours.
                            We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.
                            This information is gathered using the tracking tools described above.
                            We work with third parties who help gather this information.
                            These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect.
                            That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.</p>

                        <p>How to control tracking technologies.</p>

                        <p>You can control certain tracking tools. Many browsers give you the ability to delete or reject cookies.
                            How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can configure your browser to reject browser cookies.
                            To control flash cookies go to this page. Why? Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, and thus your browser settings will not affect them. Not all of the tracking described here will stop if cookies are deleted or blocked.
                            You can also control certain tracking tools on your mobile devices.
                            These opportunities are subject to the offerings made available by the third-party operating system providers and subject to their privacy policies, and not any offerings by or the privacy policy of SORT.
                            </br>NOTE: If you configure your computer to block cookies, you may not be able to access certain functionality on our site or the toolbar.
                            If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking activities we have described here will stop.
                            Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
                            For convenience, the following are instructions that may apply to your mobile device, though please note that the setting features may vary from device to device.</p>

                        <p>Google Android</p>

                        Devices with Google Play services 4.0 and above use the Google Android Advertising ID (AAID). To learn more about limiting ad tracking using this identifier:</br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open the Google Settings app on your device</li>
                            <li>Select Ads</li>
                            <li>Select Opt out of interest-based ads</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Apple iOS</p>

                        Devices with iOS 6 and above use the Apple Advertising Identifier (IDFA). To learn more about limiting ad tracking using this identifier:</br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open Settings app on your device</li>
                            <li>Select Privacy</li>

                            <li>Select Limit Ad Tracking</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You have options over the interest-based ads you see.</p>

                        <p>The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes.
                            If you want to opt out, visit this page. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
                            Some web browsers have a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; feature. This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.
                            These features are not yet uniform across browsers.
                            Our sites are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</br>
